/* In Phase 5 of your StockIQ project, we are focusing on building the frontend with React and Tailwind CSS and integrating it with the backend (Flask + MongoDB Atlas).

Phase 5: Frontend Development & Integration
Hereâ€™s what we need to do:

1. UI Components & Pages (React + Tailwind)
âœ… Set up React with Vite (âœ… Done)
âœ… Configure Tailwind CSS (âœ… Done)
ðŸŽ¯ Create UI Components:
ðŸ“Œ Stock Search & Selection Page (User selects stocks for analysis)
ðŸ“Œ Dashboard Page (Displays all graphs and insights)
ðŸ“Œ Navbar & Layout Components (For navigation between pages)
ðŸ“Œ Loading & Error Components (To handle API calls gracefully)
2. Graph Integration (Using Recharts or Plotly.js)
ðŸŽ¯ Render StockIQ Graphs in React
ðŸ“Œ Stock Price with Moving Averages
ðŸ“Œ Daily Returns
ðŸ“Œ RSI Over Time
ðŸ“Œ MACD Over Time (With Buy/Sell Indicators)
3. API Integration (Connecting React to Flask Backend)
ðŸŽ¯ Set up Axios or Fetch for API calls
ðŸŽ¯ Fetch stock data & pass it to graphs
ðŸŽ¯ Handle loading states and errors
4. State Management (Using React Context or Redux)
ðŸŽ¯ Manage selected stock & fetched data globally
5. Enhancements & Optimization
ðŸŽ¯ Make UI responsive (For desktop & mobile)
ðŸŽ¯ Add dark mode support (Using Tailwindâ€™s dark mode)
ðŸŽ¯ Optimize API calls (Debounce search input, caching, etc.) */


/* 
ðŸ”¥ Next Step: Phase 6 - Data Integration
Now, it's time to fetch actual stock data and integrate it into the UI. Hereâ€™s the roadmap for Phase 6:

Connect Frontend to Backend API (Flask API)
Fetch Stock Data (Using Axios/Fetch in React)
Display Charts Dynamically (Replace placeholders with real-time graphs)
Handle Loading States & Errors */


/* 
Yes, it is absolutely possible to display the stock data fetched by your Python backend in the frontend.

ðŸš€ Overview of How to Integrate Data from Backend to Frontend
Expose Flask API Endpoints

Create API routes in your Flask backend to serve stock data (e.g., /api/stocks/{symbol}).
Return data in JSON format.
Fetch Data from React Frontend

Use fetch or axios in React to call the Flask API.
Store the fetched data in React state.
Display Data in UI Components

Use the stock data in your React components.
Update charts dynamically with real-time stock prices.
